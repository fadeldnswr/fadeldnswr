## Fadel Achmad Daniswara
An undergraduate student majoring in Electrical Engineering with a specialization in Telecommunications. My academic journey is strengthened by a strong passion for bridging the fields of telecommunications, intelligent technologies, and advanced manufacturing systems. I actively explore **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, **Software Engineering**, **Internet of Things (IoT)**, and **Digital Twin**, aiming to design scalable and intelligent solutions for real-world challenges.

## Domain Interests
I am particularly interested in applying data-driven methods and intelligent systems to solve complex problems in both telecommunications and industrial domains. My focus spans:
- **Network Performance Optimization** – leveraging machine learning and AI to enhance reliability and efficiency in modern communication systems.
- **Digital Twin Technologies** – developing virtual replicas of physical systems to enable predictive analytics, real-time monitoring, and informed decision-making.
- **Digital Manufacturing** – integrating IoT, AI, and simulation models to optimize industrial processes, improve productivity, and accelerate Industry 4.0 adoption.
- **Intelligent Infrastructure Development** – creating smart systems that combine connectivity, automation, and data intelligence to shape the future of digital ecosystems.

## Projects
### Digital Twin Model for Internet of Things Network Traffic using Discrete Event Simulation
Built Digital Twin Model for IoT Network Traffic data using SimPy, a discrete event simulation based on Python. Below's the summary of the features:
- Modelled the data using Spline Interpolation with Rolling Mean and Standard Deviation for temperature and humidity
- The rest of the data modelled using Gaussian distributions where each peak value refers to the real data.
- Built the frontend integration using ReactJS, DaisyUI, and Recharts for the chart
- Created ETL pipeline for real data and simulated data into Supabase
- Displayed error metrics and statistical summary for each data columns

### Internet of Things Traffic Forecasting using Recurrent Neural Network Models
This project focuses on exploration with Recurrent Neural Network models for Time Series Forecasting in Internet of Things dataset. There are three models used in this project exploration such as SimpleRNN, LSTM and GRU. Each of the models evaluted using MSE, RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and R-squared to check the loss and accuracy for each models.

###  Internet of Things Traffic Forecasting using ARIMA
This project focuses on predicting traffic patterns using IoT data using statistical method called ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average). The goal is to forecast traffic conditions in real-time, providing valuable insights for urban planning, traffic management, and optimization.
