## Fadel Achmad Daniswara
An undergraduate student majoring in Electrical Engineering with a specialization in Telecommunications. My academic journey is strengthened by a strong passion for bridging the fields of telecommunications, intelligent technologies, and advanced manufacturing systems. I actively explore **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, **Software Engineering**, **Internet of Things (IoT)**, and **Digital Twin**, aiming to design scalable and intelligent solutions for real-world challenges.

## Domain Interests
I am particularly interested in applying data-driven methods and intelligent systems to solve complex problems in both telecommunications and industrial domains. My focus spans:
- **Network Performance Optimization** – leveraging machine learning and AI to enhance reliability and efficiency in modern communication systems.
- **Digital Twin Technologies** – developing virtual replicas of physical systems to enable predictive analytics, real-time monitoring, and informed decision-making.
- **Digital Manufacturing** – integrating IoT, AI, and simulation models to optimize industrial processes, improve productivity, and accelerate Industry 4.0 adoption.
- **Intelligent Infrastructure Development** – creating smart systems that combine connectivity, automation, and data intelligence to shape the future of digital ecosystems.

## Projects
Currently working on my bachelor thesis project called "Recommendation System Based on RUL and SoH Prediction for Smartphone Battery using Android Application and Internet of Things to Mitigate Electric Waste"
