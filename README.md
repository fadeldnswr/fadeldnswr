## Fadel Achmad Daniswara
Electrical Engineering student with a specialization in Telecommunications. My academic journey is strengthened by a strong passion for bridging the fields of telecommunications, intelligent technologies, and sustainable energy technologies. Currently exploring **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, **Software Engineering**, **Internet of Things (IoT)**, and **Digital Twin**, aiming to design scalable and intelligent solutions for real-world challenges.

## Domain Interests
Passionate about leveraging IoT, Artificial Intelligence, and Digital Twin technologies to drive innovation in sustainable energy systems. My focus area of interests include:
- **Smart Energy Systems** – developing intelligent control and monitoring frameworks that integrate IoT sensors, AI models, and real-time analytics for efficient energy generation, storage, and consumption.
- **Digital Twin for Renewable Energy** – creating dynamic digital replicas of photovoltaic, battery, and grid systems to enable predictive maintenance, performance optimization, and energy forecasting.
- **Energy-Aware IoT Networks** – designing connected systems that minimize power losses and enhance communication reliability across distributed renewable infrastructures.
- **AI-Driven Energy Optimization** – applying data-driven algorithms for demand forecasting, energy arbitrage, and operational efficiency in hybrid and microgrid environments.

## Projects
I'am working on my bachelor thesis project called _"Recommendation System Based on RUL and SoH Prediction for Smartphone Battery using Android Application and Internet of Things to Mitigate Electric Waste"_.
