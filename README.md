## Fadel Achmad Daniswara
Electrical Engineering student with a specialization in Telecommunications. My academic journey is strengthened by a strong passion for bridging the fields of telecommunications, intelligent technologies, and sustainable energy technologies. Currently exploring **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, **Software Engineering**, **Internet of Things (IoT)**, and **Digital Twin**, aiming to design scalable and intelligent solutions for real-world challenges.

## Domain Interests
Passionate about leveraging IoT, Artificial Intelligence, and Digital Twin technologies to drive innovation in telecommunication sectors. My focus area of interests include:
- **AI/ML for Network Optimization** – Applying predictive analytics and intelligent algorithms to improve resource allocation, fault detection, and QoE in wireless and broadband networks.
- **Digital Twin for Telecom Infrastructure** – Developing virtual replicas of base stations, fiber networks, and edge systems to enable real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and capacity planning.
- **Energy-Efficient Telecom Networks** – Designing low-power, adaptive communication protocols and architectures that reduce operational energy use—critical for green 5G and rural connectivity.
- **IoT-Telecom Convergence** – Building scalable, secure platforms that integrate massive IoT deployments with core and edge network functions for smart cities, utilities, and industrial applications.

## Projects
Currently working on my bachelor thesis project called _"Recommendation System Based on RUL and SoH Prediction for Smartphone Battery using Android Application and Internet of Things to Mitigate Electric Waste"_.
